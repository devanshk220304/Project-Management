## Description 
A food pantry is a place where those in need can get access to food, and it is important that the Kindness Place Food Pantry functions at its best, continuing to improve and keep with the times. This volunteer portal project involves the development of an open-source volunteer management portal specifically designed to enhance the coordination of volunteers and the distribution of tasks. This solution aims to be both scalable, accommodating the growing needs of the organization, and transferable, enabling other food pantries to readily adopt and further develop the system based on their unique requirements. The ultimate goal is to create a tool that streamlines volunteer efforts and improves the overall efficiency of food pantry operations through effective digital management. We believe that this portal will make Kindness Place Food Pantry better able to accomplish its mission of giving food to those who need it the most. The timeframe that is planned for this project is one year. This will be enough time to figure out which technologies and software are best, and work to implement them over the course of the year-long timeframe. For the project milestones, the food pantry servers will need to be upgraded and updated before the software can do the same. Once the servers, portals, and other technologies have been updated, the different software can follow suit. All of these implementations are intended for those that work at the food pantry, our volunteers, and our community.   
## Overview
The successful development of this volunteer management portal hinges on several key components. First, a comprehensive Volunteer Portal Workflow Design will map out the essential processes of volunteer onboarding, scheduling, and task assignment, clearly defining user roles and permissions for different levels of access. This will be explored in more detail later on. Second, open-source software development will leverage the skills of community coders, adhering to best practices in coding, rigorous testing methodologies, and consistent version control, culminating in an initial Version 1.0 release. Third, Community Engagement will be crucial, involving actively pitching the project to local coders and tech volunteers as a meaningful, mission-driven opportunity to contribute to the greater good, with the aim of building momentum around collaborative development that will benefit the wider community. Fourth, robust Version Control & Collaboration will be established through the use of GitHub as a central code repository, facilitating seamless collaboration and meticulous tracking of updates, documentation. issue resolution, and future contributions through open access. Finally, a commitment to Testing & Maintenance will involve implementing rigorous automated testing protocols to ensure the smooth functioning of task workflows and efficient bug identification. Automation of testing protocols will serve to ease the workload of the testers and coders and allow them to better focus on building and examining the code. This will take place alongside the scheduling of regular code reviews and community-driven maintenance efforts to ensure the long-term sustainability of the portal. 
## Project Objectives
The core objectives of this project are threefold: first, to build a functional and user-friendly volunteer management portal that effectively streamlines volunteer coordination and task distribution. Second, to foster community engagement by adopting an open-source development model, encouraging contributions and collaboration. Finally, the project aims to provide a sustainable tool that can be readily adopted, improved upon, and shared with other food pantries, thereby amplifying its impact and fostering a network of efficient volunteer-driven organizations. These objectives will be properly fulfilled for an improved food pantry and a volunteer portal that is both usable and useful. This will allow for the opportunity to grow our community by spreading our knowledge to other food pantries. 
## Principles Overview 
The project management principles discussed in class that I chose to focus on were technical debt and how to minimize it, the project workflow map and the implementation of the project, and the project’s potential risks, how to mitigate them, and the project’s sustainability. The reason why these principles were chosen was because they are all important facets of managing a project, perhaps the most important. As such, focusing on these principles will allow the most important parts of the project to be discussed.
## Principle 1: Technical Debt
In regards to the technology that will be used for this project, the most up-to-date technology and resources will be used as necessary. Older technology requires more care and maintenance, which is a form of technical debt. This means that more time will be spent on its upkeep than newer technology. Over a 5-year period, less time will be spent on the maintenance of newer technology than near-constant updates and upkeep of older technology, reducing technical debt. This means that while there still will be technical debt with this up-to-date technical stack, it will not be daunting to maintain like it would be using an older, out-of-date tech stack. The newer the technology, the better chance there is that migration to a new version will not happen as often. Version updates will be few and far between, as opposed to older technology where a lot of time needs to be spent updating their software and migrating to the latest version. The newer software should allow for more scalability as additional features are added and the technology continues to grow over this 5-year period. Technical debt will still be present, but less time will be spent going back and fixing hardware and software. The newer software and hardware in the stack will be more expensive than older, end-of-life systems, but these costs should be offset by the reduction in technical debt. With less time being spent on maintaining old technology and software, it would be less expensive to provide technical support on fixing parts of the stack for the food pantry. As a result there would be more time for new features and functionality to be implemented. The project would be able to grow faster with less technical debt. Less technical debt also means less headaches, less time wasted, and more time making the applications work for the food pantry staff.  However, outdated technology is not the only source of technical debt. According to an article by DigitalOcean, technical debt can also be caused by other reasons. A few reasons include: “Tight project schedules or urgent demands may force developers to take shortcuts to meet delivery deadlines, leading to less than ideal solutions”(DigitalOcean 1). “Failure to adhere to coding standards and best practices can lead to bad code that is difficult to read, understand, or maintain”(DigitalOcean 1). “Incomplete or insufficient testing may cause undetected bugs and vulnerabilities, leading to future complications”(DigitalOcean 1). These are not the only causes of technical debt, but they are among the most important. These potential problems can be remedied by selecting the proper volunteer coders from the community who share the project’s vision and have the drive and tenacity to succeed. Proper community engagement and community building practices will help mitigate this technical debt and help the project management recognize it and know what to do with it. This will also help the project steps be accomplished in a more timely manner with the use of up-to-date technology and the reduction of technical debt.
## Principle 2: Project Workflow and Implementation
The volunteers at Kindness Place Food Pantry are its backbone. The implementation of a new volunteer portal that quickly and clearly shows volunteer tasks is necessary so that volunteers know what they are doing immediately after they sign up for a shift. According to the website MoldStud, there are many key features of a volunteer portal, like clear navigation. The article states: “Users should easily find the information they seek”(Andersen 1). Data management is also important. According to the article: “Data management should not be overlooked. Efficient tracking of volunteer hours, activities, and impact metrics can provide valuable insights. These statistics can inform decision-making, helping organizations understand their outreach effectiveness. Such analytical capabilities are essential for continuous improvement”(Andersen 1). Security is perhaps most important: “Lastly, a secure environment is non-negotiable. Ensuring the safety of user information builds trust and encourages participation”(Andersen 1). All of these features and more will be considered in the coding process to make sure the portal works as best it can for everyone. Furthermore, the source also states that engaging content and resources is paramount for a volunteer portal. This can include items like training materials, FAQs, and various videos about working at Kindness Place.  The workflow map for volunteer check-in using the portal is below:

Each step is quick for the volunteer, and the portal is designed with ease of use in mind, as well as defining volunteer roles and their tasks. The quicker volunteers can access the portal, the less time they will waste waiting for the portal to do what it needs to. The task that the volunteer is assigned is also shown on the portal, as well as the timeframe in which the task should be done. The longest any step should take is 20 minutes. The volunteer’s schedule is also shown in a calendar format, so that the volunteer can quickly choose a day they want to volunteer, choose a time, and log out. Finally, if the volunteer wants to change their time or shift preferences, they can request a change and then confirm their new preferences. A volunteer will have both flexibility and ease of use when choosing a shift or updating their preferences, and they will know exactly what they will have to do during every shift. The levels define the volunteer workflow and interactions, with level 0 comprised of basic portal workflow tasks and interactions with the portal, and level 1 is comprised of more detailed interactions like viewing your schedule and possibly requesting a schedule change or changing the volunteer’s schedule preferences. Each flow ends with the volunteer logging out after finishing their tasks. Both the convenience and flexibility of this system will be crucial to our food pantry’s success.  The goal is for the portal to be as user-friendly and usable as possible, so that there will be no frustration when our volunteers utilize it. As for the implementation of the project, coding and designing for the greater good is key, with proper source code, code reviews, and collaboration to ensure that the portal is usable, useful, and properly managed after its implementation. Should any problems arise, fixes and updates will take place, though the hope is that with up-to-date technology, this should not be a big issue.
## Principle 3: Project Sustainability, Risks, and Mitigation
The project faces potential risks that necessitate proactive mitigation strategies. A primary risk is the lack of community coder engagement, which will be addressed by emphasizing the significant social impact of the project and actively promoting it through local tech meetups, educational institutions, and civic hacking groups to attract volunteer developers. Another key risk involves the occurrence of technical bugs or instability within the portal; this will be mitigated through the implementation of thorough code reviews, comprehensive user testing across various scenarios, and a phased rollout approach to identify and resolve issues incrementally. Finally, the challenge of ensuring long-term support for the open-source project will be tackled by meticulously documenting all development processes and fostering a contributor-friendly presence on GitHub, encouraging ongoing community involvement in updates, issue tracking, and future enhancements to ensure the project's sustainability. All of these issues are of equal importance, and making sure they are all addressed and dealt with is a clear path to the project’s success. If one issue fails to be addressed, it will affect the whole project, and it may end before completion, as many projects have. To avoid this, coordination and cooperation are both essential to make sure the project’s vision is realized. The fast, up-to-date technology will help everyone who is working on the project, and it will ultimately be what makes the project possible. However, it is almost certain that we will encounter obstacles while working through the stages of the project, and there are certainly risks involved. There are a number of ways to help with project sustainability and keep it going. According to an article by Indeed, a type of project management sustainability is called community sustainability. The article defines it as such: “Community sustainability means how people in the community, or recipients of a completed project, can access and interact with the outcome over time. This is common in non-government organization or non profits where they hope to continue outreach.” This applies to this project because Kindness Place hopes to continue to help our community and others with this volunteer portal to assist communities and reach out to them. The hope is that our community and others, with the assistance of Kindness Place, will continue to grow and thrive. However, the project has to come to fruition for this to happen. One way in which we will accomplish this is that expectations will be set for everyone who works on the project and who receives the benefit from the project. The community coders will be expected to work together to develop the portal, and the volunteers will be expected to use the portal to perform their duties to the best of their ability. This will allow other food pantries to see a food pantry that does things properly in coding and volunteering, with the aim of helping as many pantries as possible. As the example of Kindness Place Food Pantry spreads to more pantries with the promise of open access, this will be what allows the open-source project to shine. 
## Deliverables
The tangible outputs of this project will include a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the volunteer management portal, providing core features for volunteer coordination and task distribution. Comprehensive workflow documentation and clear setup instructions for the volunteer portal will also be delivered to facilitate adoption and use by food pantries. Furthermore, a publicly accessible GitHub repository will be established, containing the complete source code along with an active issue tracker to manage bugs and feature requests. Finally, a roadmap outlining planned future versions and additional features will be provided to guide ongoing development and community contributions. The long-term sustainability of this volunteer management portal relies on several key strategies. Firstly, ongoing development and updates will be fostered through the active engagement of the open-source community, encouraging continuous improvement and adaptation. Some future updates and improvements to the portal that will be prioritized include accessibility updates for those with disabilities, continuing to update security measures, and continued community engagement. Secondly, a strong emphasis will be placed on promoting knowledge transfer, ensuring that other food pantries can readily adopt and adapt the portal to their specific needs and contexts. Finally, Kindness Place is envisioned to potentially serve as a central hub for support and training, facilitating wider adoption and providing guidance to other organizations utilizing the platform.
