# EatKind
By: Grace Requeno

IS 340 Final Project, Spring 2025

## Introduction and Project Motivation
EatKind aims to create a supportive and healthy space surrounding calorie counting and nutrition tracking, which is a space that has been notoriously stigmatized. The purpose of EatKind is overall to provide a motivational and positive environment for those looking to improve or maintain healthy nutritional habits. With the rapid rise and growth of technology over the past few decades, there have been several advancements and revolutionary implementations to how humans do everyday tasks; specifically, there have been a plethora of personal health tracking apps put into the world. It is necessary and important to recognize that a lot of these health tracking apps, specifically the nutrition and calorie tracking apps, have built a bad reputation over these past several years. The creation and use of these apps have been linked to over-obsessions of weight and health to the point that many individuals have been diagnosed with eating disorders due to their intense fixations on these apps and tracking their nutrition (Eikey, 2021). When it comes to EatKind, this is something I specifically want to heavily address through the app. EatKind would aim to foster mindful habits and promote self-compassion is users’ relationships with food. This is an app that would go beyond calorie counting and restrictive dieting, and instead focus on sustainable and emotionally intelligent approaches to nutrition and personal health.

When planning and brainstorming EatKind, the target audience was very important in order to make it the most personalized and relatable experience for users. EatKind is mainly designed for those that are interested in improving or maintaining healthy habits regarding both the mind and the body. You do not have to be someone solely interested in losing weight, which seems like something most nutrition apps heavily emphasize (although it is definitely an important aspect). As long as an individual is interested in nutrition tracking through physically and mentally healthy means with a sustainable approach, EatKind is for them. Primarily, EatKind’s target audience is for adults aged 18+ who are interested in their overall wellness, mental health, and personal growth. Most often, people that are interested in using nutrition tracking apps are those who may be recovering from restrictive eating habits and/or eating disorders, diet fatigue, gym-goers, and overall people looking to align their nutritional habits with personal values such as self-care and mindfulness. Eatkind welcomes all users, with a special emphasis on those trying to change or maintain good and healthy eating habits to support their physical and mental wellness. Additionally, a secondary audience that would be important to keep in mind would be healthcare and wellness professionals. This includes individuals like therapists, dietitians/nutritionists, coaches, doctors, and more. Eatkind would serve as a great complementary tool for these professionals to use and make suggestions with their clients to help them develop healthier food habits and relationships.

The overarching goals and objectives of EatKind is to create a nutrition tracking app that supports individuals in developing healthier relationships with food, and also destigmatize and change society’s minds on the concept of dieting, nutrition tracking, and calorie counting. Traditionally, it seems like most nutrition tracking apps focus so much on data collection aligning with more strict and rigid metrics and performance goals. Moving past these core focuses by fostering and implementing an app showing kindness, mindful support, and positive reinforcement. Overall, EatKind’s objectives are to:
1.	Support mindful eating habits through awareness over judgment with prompts, reflections, and support.
2.	Reduce diet-related stress with a shame-free user experience to reduce thoughts and feels of anxiety, guilt, and obsession around eating.
3.	Promote positivity and motivation using affirmations, gamified progress systems, and mood-based feedback to help users feel empowered.

## Project Design
As for the features of this app, EatKind will implement a lot of traditional features that you may find on most nutrition tracking apps, as well as features that go beyond these traditions and norms in order to implement the positive environment that I have been so heavily emphasizing.

In terms of the more traditional features that EatKind will implement, you will of course find meal logging on the app. Meal logging is the core feature of any nutrition tracking app, allowing users to log and track what they eat on a daily basis. In supplement to this, daily, weekly, and monthly summaries would be another feature to help users track their progress over time. Another way to aid in progress tracking would be having a gamified experience. Making gamified progress tracking can greatly help with motivation to keep going with the nutrition tracking journey. Offering rewards to users that continue on with their journey has been shown to be an effective way to keep users hooked and interesting in a hobby/process (Bullock, 2024). Some more traditional features would be things like food searching and offering new recipes to users that align with their nutritional goals.

There are also some more specific features that might not be super obviously implemented in a nutrition tracking app. One of these features, which is very specific to the goals of EatKind, would be positive reinforcements through things like daily affirmations and feedback. The moment a user opens the app, they would be greeted with affirmations and reminders that they are supported on their journey to healthier eating habits. There would also be positive reminders and support when users do not meet their goals. Of course, pushing users to meet their goals is important, but it is also essential to make sure that users do not feel overly-obsessed and guilty if they occasionally go off track. Additionally, adding the option to have widgets on the users’ home screens would also be really useful. This would of course be optional for users, but would be a great way to push gentle and subliminal reminders for users to log their food. This is also an effective way to remind users to use the app without sending out so many notifications throughout the day to the point that users feel annoyed. Lastly, one of my favorite features that I would like to implement into EatKind would be chat channels as an opportunity for users to connect with each other, developers, and professionals. The ability to connect with others during the process of something that can be as strenuous as diet change could be of great support in the process.

When it comes to the actual development and design of EatKind, there are a lot of aspects to the design process to keep in mind. First, prototyping would be done through a software like Figma with a team of UI/UX designers and other business development teams in order to create the best, most marketable design and app. Eventually, the most polished and refined prototype would be implemented into code (HTML CSS, JavaScript) with a team of frontend developers. Next, backend developers would handle things like the API, databases/servers, and AI integration of the app. There is also a lot of thought that went into the idea of the design of EatKind, mainly in the color scheme and overall theme. First, I thought it would be a good idea to give the app a more modern and light feel to it, as I feel like that might feel more pleasant and positive to use. Additionally, there was some color theory that went into my ideas when choosing what color palette I wanted EatKind to implement. Green was chosen as the main color for the interface of Eatkind because of its association with concepts of harmony, growth, and balance (Kendra Cherry, 2023). EatKind promotes personal growth in all means possible, so green offering this message would be aesthetically pleasing for the app. The secondary color I chose for EatKind was orange which tends to be associated with joy, enthusiasm, and optimism (McLean, 2024). These concepts would be important for EatKind because it could subliminally aid in shifting a negative emotional tone surrounding food and wellness from one of potential pressure and guilt to one of celebration and curiosity. It is an inviting color that would help users feel like EatKind is more approachable, joyful, and exciting to use and watch their progress.

For better planning for preliminal and future purposes, I created a product creation workflow map to better visualize and understand the creation process.

**Planning Phase:** I plan to collaborate with different teams and departments, as well as potential future users, to more effectively solidify goals and features of EatKind.

**Design Phase:** It would be essential to communicate with a team of designers and front-end developers\ to understand what is feasible and what not be ultimately desirable for EatKind

**Development Phase:** Teams of front-end developers would work on the core design concepts of the app using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript + React.js. Teams of back-end developers would work on the core usability features of the app like progress tracking, personalization, AI powered feedback, and more through working with databases, servers/API, and the overall AI integration.

**Testing Phase:** It would be useful and necessary to initiate team testing and user beta testing of finished prototypes of EatKind. Testing would allow for several different outlets of opinions.

**Feedback & Iteration Phase:** Based on user beta testing and team testing of the prototype, teams would analyze the user feedback to decide on what next steps would be good in the process. This would help us decide if the current completed version/prototype meets user needs and satisfaction. If not, we would back track, improve features, and retry user testing with feedback. Once the prototype seems to meet overall satisfaction of testing, we would continue to polish development and features based on final feedback to prepare for the full initial launch.

**Prepare for Launch:** To prepare for the full launch of EatKind, we would need to work with business development teams in order to implement marketing and outreach strategies to ensure a successful initial release of the app.

**Launch:**  This is when we would release the app onto app stores! After this, ongoing feedback would be collected for future improvements.

In all, this production creation workflow map represents the main and important parts of the creation process and timeline of EatKind. There are a lot of steps a lot of time that would go into a project like this, so using something like a workflow map is crucial in order to stay organized and keep track of milestones and goals with the EatKind team.

## Open Source & Licensing
Making EatKind an open-source project would not only help the project itself thrive, but also help the community that uses EatKind thrive. Open-source projects aim to create a more welcoming and collaborative community be fostering innovation with more individuals like open-source developers (Alicea, 2025). For an app that seriously aims to create a welcome and positive environment, being open source makes sense as an attempt to create a more tight-knit and collaborative environment for users outside of something like a more strict in-app experience. The ability to connect with the actual developers of the app would be an amazing opportunity to build stronger relationships and trust, while allowing for our core team of developers to absorb and implement ideas from users to improve the app to the best of our abilities for the best user experience. Ultimately, being open source allows us to uphold values of trust and transparency by allowing users to inspect our work and code. This is an especially relevant topic considering an app like this would require quite a decent amount of data collection and handling of user data. Users would naturally become curious about how their data is being handled and how the app functions overall. Additionally, collaborative innovation is an important value to allow us to gain feedback from a diverse userbase so that we can form more inclusive improvements.

EatKind will be released under the MIT License in ordinance with open-source transparency while maintaining quality control. This license would allow EatKind to support the collaborative and community-driven culture we aim to build, while also avoiding limitations of our future business model and growth.

## Governance Structure
Regarding the governance of EatKind and the development team, shared responsibility between developers and the community is important. The structure of EatKind’s governance aims to keep the project community-driven and stable at the same time. To ensure this, there will be the core leadership and development team. This will consist of people like the founders and business development teams. Additionally, having a more community-involved council is important to allow the community and users to really see how much we care to absorb their ideas and willingness to contribute. It would be a more competitive process to be a part of the community-involved council in order to ensure that they are made of a group of users that are truly devoted to the development and growth of EatKind. Lastly, having a more open collaborative group where anyone can contribute would be important to keep in mind, especially with the different channels we would have in addition to the open-source structure.

## Community Building
In order to engage with the users and even potential users of EatKind, it would be important to attempt to build a strong community from the very start. This is when one of my core features comes into important play. When a user first creates an account, they will be prompted to join a large group channel that encompasses several mini channels and group chats that tailor to different topics and interests for users to find even more tight knit communities. Some examples could be chats for motivation, success stories, recipes, and more. Additionally, ideas like encouraging users to send personal chat introductions and sending friend requests/messages to others would be good methods to build strong initial connections. For an app that surrounds such a stigmatized and even sensitive topic for many, it is important to provide users with as much support and community as possible. Not only that, but it would also be important for the developers and EatKind team to be involved in these channels as well to build more personal relationships with the community in order to reach the tight knit community we strive so strongly to create. Additionally, to continue supporting to user-centered environment we are striving for, we would implement regular community surveys and in-app feedback prompts. It would be extremely important for us to give users a voice that is genuinely heard and considered by developers. Emphasizing this both through chat channels and accepting feedback is essential in the case of transparency, trust, and letting our community know that we truly care. EatKind strives to be built with users, not just for them.

## Technical Debt
The future of EatKind is one that needs to be treated with extra care and caution, especially considering that it is an open-source project as well. In order to ensure that the future of EatKind is sustainable, it is necessary to think of ways in which we could account for potential technical debt. To minimize technical debt, we would start with writing clear and detailed documentation of exactly how the product is being built. An example of this would be clear structure within our code, databases, and all files of EatKind. Writing clear code with important concepts in mind like useful comments and variable names would help minimize technical debt in the long run, especially so people who work on EatKind are able to understand what previous developers intended in their original work without issue. Additionally, it would be important to keep track of potential problems we may face down the road by making frameworks and looking at several different options of what tools and strategies would be most effective for us to use. Lastly, automated testing and frequent peer reviewing would be important to catch issues early on and over time to ensure clear communication and transparency between generations of developers.

## Challenges
There would be a few challenges when developing EatKind, and one of the more strenuous challenges would be finding a good balance between providing emotional support while also maintaining the technical functionality of staying accurate and providing useful statistics. We would want users to receive the most informational and accurate statistics, while also finding a way to ensure that users do not over-obsess with these statistics. Additionally, it would be difficult but crucial to ensure a respectful and kind community within the app, mainly the chat channels. This could be tackled with moderators, but very difficult to ensure 100% protection against any sort of disrespect, hate, and negativity. Lastly, it could be difficult to manage community engagement with the open-source context. Of course, we would want to maintain a high-quality product, so we would have to ensure high-quality contributions are made and implemented from our open-source model, while also creating an inclusive space of additional new ideas that have the potential to be thoughtfully integrated.

## Conclusion
EatKind’s mission is to break the stigma surrounding calorie counting and nutrition tracking. Through calculated design choices, community engagement, and spreading an overall positive message, EatKind strives to find success in the field of personal, mental, and physical wellbeing efforts. Encouraging healthy habits that nourish not only the body, but also the mind is what EatKind strives for.
